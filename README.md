# MIPS-ISA-Subset-Design
Designed a MIPS ISA subset and built a testbench to check execution of MIPS instructions set using Verilog.
Redesigned the ISA to execute special instructions apart from RISC instruction groups.
Synthesized the processor along with register file and memory on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA board.
